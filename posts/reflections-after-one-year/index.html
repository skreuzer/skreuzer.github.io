<p>Today marks my 1 year anniversary as a FreeBSD developer. I opened my first
Problem Report in 2006 and after roughly three years of hacking on the ports
system, wxs@ offered to mentor me and on March 11th, 2009 I received an email
saying that the port-mgr@ team approved his request for a commit bit for me. I
happened to be on vacation in Mexico when I got the email, and just like that a
good day turned even better.</p>
<p>The first port I ever created was for mail/p5-WWW-Hotmail. I was working for an
Internet Startup and I took the job simply because they were using FreeBSD and I
never had an opportunity to use FreeBSD in a production environment. One of the
tasks that landed in my lap was to automate the process of checking to make sure
that our newsletter was not being delivered to the spam folder of the 3 big
emails providers. I took a day or so to learn how to make ports and packages to
make it easier for me to roll out all the perl modules I needed.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t too happy working at that company, and after a while hacking on
ports became a form of therapy for me and I started to get more and more
involved with the FreeBSD project and I eventually ended up here.</p>
<p>In the past year I managed to make 148 commits and introduced several new ports
into the tree. As of today, there are 21,636 ports available, and it feels
pretty good to be a small part of that. While I would have liked to have been
able to dedicate more time, other things kept getting in the way. My 1 year
resolution is to figure out a way to better manage my time and try and set aside
a few hours per week to hack on ports.</p>
<p>I want to say thank you to wxs@, because without him, I wouldn&rsquo;t be a part
of this. I was the first person he mentored, and I consider myself very
fortunate to have gotten the chance to work with him. He is extremely bright and
very patience and just an all around good guy. Even today when I paint myself
into a corner, I can always ask him for help and every time he has managed to
guide me in the direction I wanted to go. I owe a great deal to him and consider
him to be a very valuable addition to the FreeBSD developer community as a
whole.</p>
